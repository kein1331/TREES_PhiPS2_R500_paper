The code in this folder is known to compile successfully under Linux and MacOS, and probably can be compiled under most UNIX type environments. The code is written in C++ and is compiled using the UNIX shell 'make' command:

make trees3

If there are .o files and you either moved them from another computer OR you have modified any header (*.h) file, then compile TREES as follows:

make clean
make trees3

To run TREES from the current location, enter:

./trees3

Running the model this way will require you to enter information at prompts. Alternatively, the workshop examples include "in files" that obviate the need to respond to these prompts. Run the model using an "in file" called 'in1' as follows:

./trees3 < in1

The '<' instructs the shell to direct the contents of the text file, in-file, into trees3 prompts.

Typically, data folders will be separate from the code. The workshop files are organized as follows (and downloadable as a zip file):

TREES-workshop-2020/
  Examples/
    Brassica/
    Maize/
    Pinon/
  Model-Code/
  Rscripts/
  Graphics/
  
With the above file organization unzipped on your computer, you can run TREES for the Brassica example by entering:

cd $PATH/TREES-workshop-2020/Examples/Brassica/
../../Model-Code/trees3 < in_cc_ww.txt

There are three output files generated by TREES, all in tab-delimited format with one line for each time step. 

The file with ".sim" extension contains the major of simulation outputs, the ".leaf" file contains time series of area for every leaf, and ".hyd" files contain information for reconstructing the hydraulic status (cavitated hydraulic conductance, minimum water potential, and Weibull b & c parameters) for each plant segment at each time step.
